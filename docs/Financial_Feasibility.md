# Financial Feasibility: Glimpse

## Team Investment
- **Team**: 5 members (Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, ML Engineer, Integration Specialist, QA/DevOps Engineer).
- **Effort**:
  - Estimated hours: 12 hours/week per member x 8 weeks = 480 total hours.
  - Roles:
    - Frontend: 120 hours (UI, React Native, Native Module).
    - Backend: 96 hours (Supabase setup, Edge Functions).
    - ML Engineer: 96 hours (model development, deployment).
    - Integration Specialist: 48 hours (Research & documentation for Notification Listener).
    - QA/DevOps: 120 hours (testing, CI/CD setup).
- **Cost**:
  - Blended student stipend rate: ₹100/hour (a minimal cost for a student or intern team).
  - Total Team Stipend: 480 hours x ₹100/hour = ₹48,000.

## Cost Estimation
- **Infrastructure**:
  - **Supabase**: Pro tier for reliability and to avoid usage limits during development (~₹2,100/month).
  - **API Tools**: Postman (Free tier is sufficient for prototype needs).
  - Total: ~₹2,100/month.
- **Tools**:
  - **Development**: VS Code, npm/yarn, GitHub (free tier sufficient).
  - **Collaboration**: GitHub Free plan provides all necessary features for a small team.
  - **ML Tools**: Google Colab (Free tier) is adequate for developing the initial model.
  - Total: ₹0/month.
- **Testing**:
  - Emulators (Xcode, Android Studio): Free.
  - **Distribution & Monitoring**: Small budget for services like Firebase for reliable APK sharing and basic monitoring (~₹1,250/month).
  - Total: ~₹1,250/month.
- **Total Cost**:
  - Monthly Operational Cost (Infrastructure + Testing): ~₹3,350.
  - Total Operational Cost (2 months): ₹3,350 x 2 = ₹6,700.
  - Team Stipend (hypothetical, one-time): ₹48,000.
  - **Two-month total: ₹48,000 (Stipend) + ₹6,700 (Operational) = ₹54,700**.

## Benefits
- **Industry Potential**: Freemium model post-prototype (e.g., ₹299/month for premium features like advanced analytics or integrations).
- **ROI Potential**: An exceptionally low initial investment (under ₹55,000) makes the project an almost zero-risk, high-reward candidate.

## Conclusion
The project is financially feasible, with a total estimated cost of **₹54,700** for the entire 8-week development cycle. This cost structure maximizes the ROI potential while minimizing the initial investment.
