# Technical Feasibility: Glimpse

## Software Requirements
- **Frontend**:
  - **React Native**: For the Android mobile app.
  - **TypeScript**: For type safety, improved code quality, and easier collaboration.
  - **Supabase JavaScript Client**: For Auth, database queries, and real-time subscriptions.
  - Tools: VS Code, npm/yarn for package management.
- **Backend**:
  - **Supabase**: Provides PostgreSQL, Auth, Edge Functions, real-time syncing.
  - **Node.js**: For local development and testing of Edge Functions.
- **ML Pipeline**:
  - **spaCy/NLTK**: Lightweight NLP libraries for keyword-based prioritization.
  - **Supabase Edge Functions**: Hosts pre-trained ML model for inference.
  - **Python**: For model development (local), using scikit-learn or spaCy.
- **Testing/Deployment**:
  - **Jest**: For unit testing frontend.
  - **Postman**: For API testing.
  - **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD.
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub for collaboration.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Development**:
  - Standard developer laptops (8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, multi-core CPU).
  - Internet access for API calls, Supabase, and GitHub.
- **Testing**:
  - Android devices or emulators (e.g., Android Studio).
- **Deployment**:
  - Supabase cloud (free tier) for backend.
  - No dedicated servers needed; cloud-based infrastructure suffices.

## Feasibility Assessment
- **Strengths**:
  - Supabase simplifies backend setup, reducing development time.
  - TypeScript** will catch errors early, improving development speed and reducing bugs.
  - Pre-trained ML models (e.g., spaCy) minimize training effort.
  - React Native provides a modern framework for building the Android UI.
- **Risks**:
  - **Native Module Complexity**: Implementing the Android Notification Listener service in React Native requires native coding knowledge and can be complex to debug.
  - ML model accuracy may be limited (target: 80%) due to minimal training data.
  - Teamâ€™s familiarity with Supabase/ML may require learning curve.
- **Mitigation**:
  - **Integration Specialist** to perform thorough research and provide clear documentation for the Frontend Developer. Allocate sufficient time for this task.
  - Start with a simple ML model; refine post-prototype if time allows.
  - Leverage Supabase documentation and tutorials for quick onboarding.

## Conclusion
Technically feasible within two month. Risks are manageable with proper planning.
