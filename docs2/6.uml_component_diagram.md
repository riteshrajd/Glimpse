# Component Diagram Explanation

## 1. Component Descriptions

* **User Interface (UI)**
    * Acts as the front-end of the application.
    * Handles all direct user interaction.
    * Renders controls and displays processed images.

* **App Controller**
    * Serves as the central coordinator.
    * Receives requests from the UI.
    * Delegates tasks to the appropriate backend services.

* **Image Processing Service**
    * Functions as the core logic engine for image manipulation.
    * Loads FITS data and applies post-processing adjustments.
    * Encapsulates logic from `ImageProcessor`, `FITSData`, and `ProcessedImage` classes.

* **AI Model Engine**
    * Manages the loading and execution of the AI prediction model.
    * Isolated to allow for easy model updates or replacement.
    * Based on the `AIModel` class.

* **History Management Service**
    * Creates, stores, and retrieves the history of user actions.
    * Based on the `HistoryManager` and `HistoryItem` classes.

## 2. Interaction Flow

The typical interaction sequence between components is as follows:

1.  The **User** performs an action on the **User Interface (UI)**.
2.  The **UI** forwards this request to the **App Controller**.
3.  The **App Controller** directs the **Image Processing Service** to perform the task.
4.  The **Image Processing Service** calls the **AI Model Engine** to get a prediction.
5.  The **App Controller** then instructs the **History Management Service** to log the completed action.
6.  Throughout the process, the services access the **File System** to read and write necessary files (FITS, models, images, logs).
