# UML Class Diagram for Astro Image Colorizer AI

This diagram outlines the primary classes responsible for implementing the application's features.

***

### 1. `AppController`
The central orchestrator that connects the user interface to the backend processing logic.

***

### 2. `ImageProcessor`
Handles the core image processing workflow, from loading data to running the AI model.

***

### 3. `FITSData`
A data class that holds the raw, multi-channel data and metadata from a FITS file.

***

### 4. `AIModel`
An abstract class representing a trained AI model. Different models can be implemented as subclasses.

***

### 5. `ProcessedImage`
A class to hold the final, colorized RGB image and handle adjustments.

***

### 6. `HistoryManager`
Manages the user's processing history for the current session.

***

### 7. `HistoryItem`
A simple data object representing one entry in the history log.

***


## UML Class Diagram Relationships

### AppController -> ImageProcessor & HistoryManager
**Composition**: The `AppController` owns and manages its core components, the `ImageProcessor` and `HistoryManager`.

***

### ImageProcessor -> AIModel
**Dependency**: The `ImageProcessor` temporarily uses an `AIModel` to perform the colorization task but doesn't store it as a permanent attribute.

***

### ImageProcessor -> FITSData & ProcessedImage
**Association**: The `ImageProcessor` holds a direct link to a `FITSData` object as its input and a `ProcessedImage` object as its output.

***

### HistoryManager -> HistoryItem
**Composition**: `HistoryItem` objects are owned by and stored within the `HistoryManager`'s `historyLog`.

***

### HistoryItem -> ProcessedImage
**Association**: Each `HistoryItem` is linked to the `ProcessedImage` it represents, allowing it to store an `outputThumbnail`.
