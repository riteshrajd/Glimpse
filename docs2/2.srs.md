# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Multi-Spectral Image Translator

## 1. Functional Requirements

- **FR-1: FITS File Upload:** The application must allow users to upload astronomical data files in the standard FITS format.
- **FR-2: AI-Powered Colorization:** A deep-learning model will process the multi-channel FITS data to generate a single, full-color image (PNG/JPG).
- **FR-3: AI Model Selection:** Users will be able to select from different AI models, each optimized for specific classes of celestial objects (e.g., Nebulae, Galaxies).
- **FR-4: Color Palette Selection:** Users can choose from predefined color mapping palettes (e.g., Hubble Palette SHO, Natural Color RGB) to guide the AI's output.
- **FR-5: Image Comparison View:** The application will provide a side-by-side viewer to compare the original data representation with the final colorized image.
- **FR-6: Post-Processing Controls:** Users will have access to simple sliders to adjust the brightness, contrast, and saturation of the final generated image.
- **FR-7: Metadata Display:** The application will parse and display key scientific metadata from the uploaded FITS file's header.
- **FR-8: Image Export:** Users can download the final colorized image in high-quality standard formats like PNG or JPG.
- **FR-9: Web Platform:** The application will be a responsive web application accessible through modern browsers.
- **FR-10: Cloud Infrastructure:** The backend services and AI model will be deployed on a scalable cloud platform, such as AWS or Google Cloud.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-1: Processing Time:** The time between file upload and image display shall not exceed 30 seconds for a standard-sized file.
- **NFR-2: UI Responsiveness:** The user interface must respond to user interactions, such as slider adjustments, within 500 milliseconds.
- **NFR-3: Concurrent Users:** The system will be designed to handle at least 10 concurrent image processing requests without significant performance degradation.
- **NFR-4: Service Availability:** The backend services will have a minimum uptime of 99.5%.
- **NFR-5: Output Integrity:** The AI's output must be a faithful and artifact-free representation of the scientific data in the input FITS file.
- **NFR-6: Fault Tolerance:** The application will gracefully handle invalid file formats, large file sizes, and network interruptions without crashing.
- **NFR-7: Data Encryption:** All data transferred between the client and server will be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.
- **NFR-8: Data Privacy:** User-uploaded files and generated images will be automatically and permanently deleted from the server after a short, defined period (e.g., 1 hour).
- **NFR-9: UI Simplicity:** The UI will be clean, intuitive, and require no specialized scientific knowledge for basic operation.

## 3. Goal of Implementation

The goal of implementation is to build a robust, scalable, and user-friendly web application based on the defined requirements. This involves creating an efficient data processing pipeline, training and deploying a high-quality AI model, and delivering a seamless user experience that makes the complexities of astronomical imaging accessible to a wider audience.
