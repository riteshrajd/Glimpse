# Project Summary: Multi-Spectral image Translator

## Outcome
Astro Image Colorizer AI is a web app that uses a deep-learning model to transform raw, multi-spectral data from telescopes like Hubble into meaningful, full-color images. It aims to automate complex astronomical imaging, creating a powerful tool for scientific analysis and public outreach.

## Feasibility Study

### Technical Feasibility
- **Software Stack**:
    - **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), PyTorch/TensorFlow
    - **Data:** Astropy, NumPy
    - **Frontend:** React (TypeScript)
- **Development Tools**: VS Code, Git/GitHub, Docker, Google Colab.
- **Strengths**:
    - Abundant free data from public NASA/ESA archives.
    - Mature open-source libraries (Astropy, PyTorch) are available.
    - Modular design allows for clear team roles (Data, AI, Frontend).
- **Risks & Mitigations**:
    - **Risk (Data Curation):** Aligning raw FITS data with color images is time-consuming. **Mitigation:** Specialize in one object type (e.g., Nebulae) and automate the data pipeline.
    - **Risk (Compute Cost):** Training a model is computationally expensive. **Mitigation:** Use Transfer Learning on a pre-trained model and free resources like Google Colab.

### Financial Feasibility
- **Team Investment**: A 4-member team for 8 weeks (480 hours effort) with a hypothetical stipend of ₹48,000.
- **Cost Estimation**:
    - **Infrastructure:** ~₹3,000/month (GPU cloud VM & hosting).
    - **Data:** ₹0 (public archives).
    - **Total Project Cost (2 months):** ₹54,000.
- **Benefits**: A high-impact portfolio project with future potential as a specialized tool for researchers or a paid API for science communicators.

## Result
The project is **feasible**. The technical plan is solid and leverages mature technologies. Key risks in data curation are manageable through specialization and automation. With minimal financial cost, it is a low-risk, high-impact project achievable within the 8-week timeline.
